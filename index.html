                <p> In 1981 when Slayer first formed in Huntington Park, CA, bassist/vocalist Tom Araya was 20 years
                    old and worked as a respiratory therapist, guitarist Jeff Hanneman, a rehearsal studio employee at
                    the time, was 17, drummer Dave Lombardo was 16 and delivered pizza, and 17-year old Kerry King
                    was a full-time guitarist. At that time, there were no blueprints, no set paths, no boundaries or steps
                    to follow, Slayer's new hybrid of metal and punk, heavier, faster and darker than the rest, assaulted
                    the world and set a new standard, defining not only a genre, but an attitude.
                    Fast forward nearly 37-years and Slayer remains the preeminent punk-thrash-metal band that other
                    heavy acts are measured against and aspire to, and up-and-coming metal heads continue to revere
                    and emulate. Slayer is a metal juggernaut, with songs that are dark, aggressive and without mercy, mirroing the turmoil andf aberrations of our society. in September 2015, Slayer released Repentless, the band's 12th studio album, the first without Han-
                    neman, first with Holt on guitar, first with producer Terry Date, and first on Nuclear Blast Records, to
                    widespread rave reviews and the highest chart debut of the band's career. The band also teamed
                    up with director BJ McDonnell for three high-concept and brutal music videos for the album's title
                    track, then for "You Against You," and the most recent, "Pride in Prejudice," racking up a combined
                    28+-million views. Dark Horse Comics published a three-issue comic book series in 2016, based on Mc-
                    Donnells original story concept for the videos and witten by "Metalocalypse" director Jon Schnepp.
                    On January 22, 2018, after a remarkable three-and-a-half decades, Slayer announced its decision to do
                    one last world tour and then move on: All Hail Slayer:</p>

                <p>Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981. Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera introduced the new singer Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released Power Metal in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's Cowboys from Hell, Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's Vulgar Display of Power, exhibited an even heavier sound. Far Beyond Driven (1994) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Pantera went on hiatus in 2001 and was disbanded in 2003. The band has sold more than 60 million records as of August 2017.</p>
